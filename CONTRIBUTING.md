Process of Pull Requests

Currently, SlmLocale is maintained by Jurian Sluiman (@juriansluiman). If you want to become a main contributor, you can request push access to this repository to merge code yourself.

If you are willing to contribute a substantial new part to SlmLocale, please discuss this first via the [Github issues](http://github.com/juriansluiman/SlmLocale/issues). You might be unaware of a different initiative with similar goals and that will save you quite some development time.
